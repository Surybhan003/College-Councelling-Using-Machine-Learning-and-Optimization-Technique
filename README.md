# College Counseling Using Machine Learning and Optimization Technique

## Description
This project provides a smart college counseling system that utilizes machine learning and optimization techniques to recommend the best-fit colleges for students based on various factors such as rank, preferred location, stream, category quota, and more. It aims to simplify the decision-making process for students during counseling by offering tailored recommendations.

## Features
- **Personalized College Recommendations**: Based on student preferences and rank.
- **Incorporates Quotas**: Supports category-based (General, OBC, SC/ST), home/other state, and gender-specific quotas.
- **Optimization-Based Approach**: Ensures that the recommendations maximize suitability for the student.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified interaction for students to input their preferences.

## Dataset
- **Input Requirements**:
  - Student rank (JEE Mains/Advance or equivalent exams)
  - Preferred location
  - Preferred stream (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, etc.)
  - Quota details (category, home/other state, gender)
- **Output**: A list of colleges ranked based on their suitability for the given inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (or any other relevant library)
- **Optimization Library**: SciPy, PuLP
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Interface (Optional)**: Streamlit or Flask
